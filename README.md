# React + Vite + Hono + Cloudflare Workers

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/vite-react-template)

This template provides a minimal setup for building a React application with TypeScript and Vite, designed to run on Cloudflare Workers. It features hot module replacement, ESLint integration, and the flexibility of Workers deployments.

## Getting Started

To start a new project with this template, run:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=cloudflare/templates/vite-react-template
```

A live deployment of this template is available at:
[https://react-vite-template.templates.workers.dev](https://react-vite-template.templates.workers.dev)

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Demo API (serverless-friendly)

This template includes a minimal echo endpoint that waits ~1ms and returns the input JSON with `processed: true`.

Endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5173/api/echo" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: change-me" \
  -d '{"message":"hello"}'
```

## Security & Cost Controls (best-practice defaults)

Serverless has no "always-on" app server, so protection lives inside the Worker:

- **API key gate**: blocks anonymous traffic before any expensive work.
- **Rate limit**: basic in-memory bucket to prevent bursts from single IPs.
- **Input limits**: body size + query length to stop oversized payloads.
- **Timeout + retry**: outbound calls are bounded so upstream slowness doesn't blow up cost.

In production, upgrade the rate limiter to a durable store (KV or Durable Objects) so limits are shared across all edge nodes.

## Production

Build your project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview your build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Deploy your project to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run build && npm run deploy
```

Monitor your workers:

```bash
npx wrangler tail
```
